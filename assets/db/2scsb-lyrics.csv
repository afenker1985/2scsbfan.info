Who crossed the great mountains with her lover Ike,<br />
With two yoke of oxen, and one spotted hog,<br />
A tall Shangai rooster, and an old yeller dog?<br /><br />

And out on the prairie rolled all sorts o' trash.<br />
A few little baby clothes done up with care<br />
Looked a little suspicious, but all on the square.<br /><br />

The Injuns came down in a wild yellin' horde,<br />
And Betsy was scared they would scalp her adored.<br />
Behind the front wagon wheel Betsy did crawl.<br />
It was there she fought Injuns with musket and ball.<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus</strong><br /><br />

They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out,<br />
And down in the sand she lay rollin' about,<br />
While Ike, in great horror, looked on with surprise,<br />
Saying, &quot;Betsy, get up! You'll get sand in your eyes!&quot;<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus</strong><br /><br />

Sweet Betsy got up with a great deal of pain,<br />
Announced she would go to Pike County again;<br />

20,NULL,"Would you like to hear my song? I'm afraid it's rather long,<br />
Of the famous &quot;On to Richmond&quot; double trouble,<br />
Of a half a dozen trips and a half a dozen slips<br />
And the very latest bursting of the bubble.<br />
'Tis pretty hard to sing and, like a round, round ring,<br />
'Tis a dreadful knotty puzzle to unravel.<br />
Though all the papers swore, when we touched Virginia's shore,<br />
That Richmond was a hard road to travel.<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus:</strong><br />
Then pull off your coat and roll up your sleeve,<br />
Richmond is a hard road to travel.<br />
Then pull off your coat and roll up your sleeve,<br />
For Richmond is a hard road to travel, I believe.<br /><br />

First McDowell, bold and gay, set forth the shortest way<br />
By Manassas in the pleasant summer weather,<br />
But unfortunately ran on a Stonewall—foolish man!—<br />
And had a rocky journey altogether.<br />
And he found it rather hard to ride o'er Beauregard<br />
And Johnston proved a deuce of a bother.<br />
And 'twas clear beyond a doubt that he didn't like the route<br />
And a second time would have to try another.<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus:</strong><br />
Then pull off your coat and roll up your sleeve,<br />
Manassas is a hard road to travel.<br />
Manassas gave us fits, and Bull Run made us grieve,<br />
And Richmond is a hard road to travel, I believe.<br /><br />

Next came the Wooly Horse with an overwhelming force<br />
To march down to Richmond by the Valley,<br />
But he couldn't find the road, and his onward movement showed<br />
His campaigning was a mere shilly-shally.<br />
Then Commissary Banks, with his motley foreign ranks,<br />
Kicking up a great noise of fuss and flurry,<br />
Lost the whole of his supplies and, with tears in his eyes,<br />
From the Stonewall ran away in a hurry.<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus:</strong><br />
Then pull off your coat and roll up your sleeve,<br />
The Valley is the hard road to travel.<br />
The Valley wouldn't do, and we all had to leave,<br />
For Richmond is a hard road to travel, I believe.<br /><br />

Then McClellan followed soon, with both spade and balloon,<br />
To try the Peninsular approaches,<br />
But one and all agreed that his best rate of speed<br />
Was no faster than the slowest of slow coaches.<br />
Instead of easy ground, at Williamsburg he found<br />
A Longstreet indeed and nothing shorter;<br />
And it put him in the dumps that spades wasn't trumps,<br />
And the Hills he couldn't level as ordered!<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus:</strong><br />
Then pull off your coat and roll up your sleeve,<br />
For a Longstreet is a hard road to travel.<br />
Lay down the shovel, and throw away the spade,<br />
For Richmond is a hard road to travel, I'm afraid.<br /><br />

Then Lincoln said to Pope, &quot;You can make the trip, I hope.<br />
I will save the universal Yankee nation!<br />
To make sure of no defeat, I'll leave no line of retreat,<br />
And issue a famous proclamation!&quot;<br />
But that same dreaded Jackson, this fella laid his whacks on<br />
And made him, by compulsion, a seceder.<br />
And Pope took rapid flight from Manassas' second fight,<br />
'Twas his very last appearance as a leader.<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus:</strong><br />
Then pull off your coat and roll up your sleeve,<br />
For a Stonewall is a hard road to travel.<br />
Pope did his very best but was evidently sold,<br />
For Richmond is a hard road to travel, I am told.<br /><br />

Last of all the brave Burnside, with his pontoon bridges, tried<br />
A road no one had thought of before him,<br />
With two hundred thousand men for the Rebel slaughter pen<br />
And the blessed Union flag waving o'er him.<br />
But he met a fire like hell of canister and shell<br />
That mowed down his men with great a-slaughter.<br />
'Twas a shocking sight to view, that second Waterloo,<br />
And the river ran with more blood than with water.<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus:</strong><br />
Then pull off your coat and roll up your sleeve,<br />
Rappahannock is a hard road to travel.<br />
Burnside got in a trap, which caused him for to grieve,<br />
For Richmond is a hard road to travel, I believe.<br /><br />

Now we are very much perplexed to know who is the next<br />
To command the new Richmond expedition,<br />
For the capital must blaze, and that in ninety days,<br />
And Jeff and his men be sent to perdition.<br />
We'll take the cursed town, and burn it to the ground<br />
And plunder and hang each cursed Rebel.<br />
Yet the contraband was right when he told us they would fight:<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, massa, dey will fight like the debil!&quot;<br /><br />

Sweet Evalina, dear Evalina,<br />
My love for you will never, never die!<br />
Dear Evalina, sweet Evalina,<br />
My love for thee will never, never die!<br /><br />

She's fair like the rose, like the lamb she is meek,<br />
And she never was known to put paint on her cheek.<br />
In the most graceful curls hangs her raven black hair,<br />
And she never requires perfumery there.<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus</strong><br /><br />

Evalina and I one fond evening in June,<br />
Took a walk all alone by the light of the moon;<br />
The planets all shone, for the heavens were clear,<br />
And I felt round the heart, oh, most mightily queer.<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus</strong><br /><br />

Three years have gone by, and I've not got a dollar.<br />
Evalina still lives in the green grassy holler.<br />
Although I am fated to marry her never,<br />
I'll love her, for sure, forever and ever.<br /><br />

Upon my country's altar,<br />
Upon my country's altar,<br />
Here's my heart and here's my hand,<br />
Upon my country's altar.<br /><br />

Then Heaven be with us in the strife,<br />
Be with the Southern soldier,<br />
We'll drive that mercenary horde,<br />
Beyond our Southern border,<br />
Beyond our Southern border,<br />
We'll drive that mercenary horde,<br />
Beyond our Southern border.<br /><br />

So I'll place my knapsack on my back,<br />
My rifle on my shoulder,<br />
I'll march away to the firing line,<br />
And kill that Yankee soldier,<br />
I'll kill that Yankee soldier,<br />
I'll march away to the firing line,<br />
And I'll kill that Yankee soldier!<br /><br />

Well, I wish I was in the land of cotton,<br />
Old time there are not forgotten;<br />
Look away! Look away! Look away, Dixie Land!<br />
In Dixie's Land where I was born in,<br />
Early on one frosty mornin',<br />
Look away! Look away! Look away, Dixie Land!<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus:</strong><br />
Then I wish I was in Dixie! Hooray! Hooray!<br />
In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand, to live and die in Dixie!<br />
Away! Away! Away down South in Dixie!<br />
Away! Away! Away down South in Dixie!<br /><br />

Old Missus married &quot;Will the Weaver&quot;<br />
William was a gay deceiver!<br />
Look away! Look away! Look away, Dixie Land!<br />
And when he put his arms around her,<br />
Smiled as fierce as a forty-pounder!<br />
Look away! Look away! Look away, Dixie Land!<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus</strong><br /><br />

So here's to the health of the next old missus<br />
And the gals that want to kiss us!<br />
Look away! Look away! Look away, Dixie Land!<br />
Now if you want to drive away sorrow,<br />
Come and hear our song tomorrow!<br />
Look away! Look away! Look away, Dixie Land!<br /><br />

<strong>Chorus</strong><br /><br />

Well, I wish I was in the land of cotton,<br />
Old time there are not forgotten;<br />
Look away! Look away! Look away, Dixie Land!<br />
In Dixie's Land where I was born in,<br />
Early on one frosty mornin',<br />
Look away! Look away! Look away, Dixie Land!<br /><br />
